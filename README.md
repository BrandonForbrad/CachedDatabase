# CachedDatabase
Introducing the CacheService (Roblox Cache Framework) - an advanced system designed to optimize data storage, retrieval, and replication in Roblox games. This powerful framework incorporates cached datastore saves with datastore session locking, providing enhanced performance and security. With an array of useful functions, including a clean cache feature and client replication capabilities, it empowers developers to streamline their game's data management process.


At the core of the CacheService lies its cached datastore saves with datastore session locking mechanism. This feature leverages the power of caching to minimize the number of expensive datastore calls, significantly reducing latency and improving overall game performance. Additionally, the framework implements session locking to ensure data integrity, preventing concurrent data modification conflicts.


One of the standout features of the framework is the clean cache function. With a single command, developers can completely clear the cache, closing any Roblox-created threads or connections and deleting associated user data values. This functionality is invaluable for scenarios where a fresh start or data refresh is necessary, saving development time and eliminating potential data inconsistencies.


Moreover, the CacheService offers robust client replication capabilities. It enables efficient and secure data synchronization between the server and clients, ensuring that all connected players receive the most up-to-date information. With this feature, game developers can effortlessly replicate essential data, such as player attributes, inventory, or game state, to the client, providing a seamless and immersive experience for players.


Beyond these core functionalities, the framework provides a plethora of additional useful functions and utilities. These include data serialization and deserialization methods for seamless storage and retrieval of complex data structures, efficient cache expiration and refreshing mechanisms, error handling and logging functionalities, and customizable event hooks for easy integration with existing game systems.


In summary, the CacheService is a comprehensive solution for optimized data management in Roblox games. Its cached datastore saves with datastore session locking ensure enhanced performance and data integrity, while the clean cache function allows for quick resets and data purging. Combined with client replication features, this framework empowers developers to create robust and responsive game experiences.
